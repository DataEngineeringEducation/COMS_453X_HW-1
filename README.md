## Introduction

In this assignment you will prepare the necessary resources for interfacing with the class and
completing assignments.  For this assignment you will complete tutorials and achieve basic
proficiency with three main tools:

1. Git
2. Markdown
3. LaTeX

## Git

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes and coordinating work on digital files among multiple people.
Version control, or revision/source control is a way to manage changes on documents, code, or other data to allow 
concurrent editing, resolution of conflicts, and long-term management and saving of changes.  You can read more 
about why using revision control in higher education is important for your future [here](https://medium.com/@jsiarto/version-control-and-higher-education-78dc8e3f66f1#.wbogkr8rl) and [here](https://jarofgreen.co.uk/2013/05/why-programmers-should-learn-git/).

- [ ] Complete the
  [Git 101 Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) -
  this should take about 15 minutes.
- [ ] Review the Github
  [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
  which will help you remember key commands and workflows with Git.
- [ ] Make note of the additional resources available
  [here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
  for going deeper into your learning about git and Github.

## Markdown

Since we will be using git for all assignments in this class, it will
be important for you to learn **Markdown**.  Markdown is a lightweight
language for formatting text which is designed to be more human
readable than most markup languages, like HTML, but also to be easily
rendered in HTML, or rich text display formats.  Markdown is the
preferred language of git readme files, and is the language used to
code the file you are reading.

- [ ] Read the *Mastering Markdown* guide available
  [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- [ ] In your checked out homework, make sure you click the boxes for
  this assignment of completed objectives, and commit the changes to git!
